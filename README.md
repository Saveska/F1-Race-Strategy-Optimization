## F1 Race Strategy Optimization

This repository contains my Formula 1 Race Strategy Optimization thesis, where I apply EDA and regression models to analyze pit-stop strategies, tyre choices and lap times. The goal is to optimize race strategies based on historical data.

## Project Overview
Data Used: Historical F1 race data from the 2024 season, up to and including the Dutch Grand Prix.  
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
Models Used: Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting.  
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
