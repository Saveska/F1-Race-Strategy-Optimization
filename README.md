## 🏁 F1 Race Strategy Optimization

This repository contains the code and data analysis behind my Computer Science thesis: Optimization of Race Strategy in Formula 1 using Machine Learning. The goal of this project was to explore how historical race data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of race strategies — focusing on pit-stop timing, tire compounds, and lap performance.

This project was accepted for presentation at the International Conference on Informatics and Information Technologies (CIIT 2025).

## 🏎️ Project Overview

### Objective
Analyze historical F1 data to understand which strategic decisions correlate with better race outcomes.
Focus areas included:
  - Tire compound usage
  - Pit stop strategies
  - Lap time patterns
  - Position changes
    
### Data
Lap-by-lap data from the 2024 Formula 1 season up to and including the Dutch Grand Prix. The datasets include weather, track conditions, pit stop logs, and driver positions.

### Models Used
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
